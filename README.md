1.segment distribution visualisation(still running, at 3800mins)
2.classify between naive topologies using segment distribution (bug not fixed yet).
    2.5. Seems need to use Gamma as time's prior instead of exponential?
    Need to repeat the segment experiment in two populations.
3.design proper prior for segment distribution
